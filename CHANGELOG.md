# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-30

### Changed (breaking)
- `/develop` now auto-detects YAML frontmatter on the latest plan-report and
  switches between two modes:
  - **frontmatter present** → new "C3 main + PO spot" workflow. C3 walks the
    DAG wave-by-wave, asks for user approval before each wave, and dispatches
    each wave to the right runner: solo waves run on the C3 host (Agent-tool
    spawn for `code-reviewer` / `developer` / `tester`, parent-Claude persona
    adoption for `tdd-develop` to avoid the depth-1 nested-spawn limit), and
    multi-task waves are delegated to parallel-orchestra via an ephemeral
    wave-only manifest under `.claude/tmp/`.
  - **no frontmatter** → legacy D-1〜D-5 sequential TDD ceremony, unchanged.
- The previous "PO 全委譲" model (D-0 two-choice prompt) and
  `.claude/skills/parallel-execution.md` are removed. The new flow is
  documented in `.claude/skills/wave-execution.md`.

### Added
- `c3 po waves <plan-report>` — prints the topological wave decomposition of
  a manifest as JSON. Used by `wave-execution.md` to drive the per-wave loop.
- `c3 po run-wave <plan-report> --wave-index N` — generates a wave-only
  ephemeral manifest under `.claude/tmp/po-manifest-wave-{N}-{ts}.md` and
  hands it to parallel-orchestra.
- `c3.po.manifest.compute_waves(frontmatter)` — Kahn's-algorithm topological
  wave decomposition. Detects cycles, unknown dependency ids, and duplicate
  task ids.
- `c3.po.manifest.build_wave_manifest_text(frontmatter, wave_index)` —
  emits a parseable plan-report Markdown for one wave, dropping `depends_on`
  and webhook fields and decorating the manifest name with ` - wave N`.
- `tests/test_po_waves.py` (16 tests) and `tests/test_cli_po.py` (5 tests)
  covering wave decomposition, ephemeral-manifest generation, CLI exit
  codes, and frontmatter round-trip.

### Notes
- The persona-adoption pattern for `tdd-develop` in solo waves is the direct
  consequence of Claude Code's depth-1 nested-spawn limit (a sub-agent
  spawned via the Agent tool cannot itself spawn another sub-agent). For
  agents that internally spawn sub-agents (today: `tdd-develop`), the parent
  Claude reads the agent definition and adopts its persona instead. Other
  agents (`code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `developer`, `tester`) keep
  using the standard Agent-tool spawn path.

### Docs
- Operational rules captured from a 17-tasks / 7-stages verification run in
  `c3_pip_test`:
  - `.claude/skills/wave-execution.md`: new **Step 0-pre** that requires a
    clean working tree before invoking PO (PO's auto-merge re-creates
    same-named files in worktrees and conflicts on dirty main — most
    commonly via `.claude/settings.local.json`, which Claude Code auto-edits
    when granting permissions). Adds an explicit **"do not git
    add/commit/push"** rule to case A-2 Agent-tool prompts (a developer
    sub-agent was committing implementation files while leaving Red tests
    and test-reports untracked). Adds an **auto-merge conflict (exit code
    3) recovery** sub-section under case B with a selective-checkout
    procedure that rescues only declared `writes` and discards worktree-
    side edits to surrounding files. Adds a per-wave commit reminder under
    Step 2-F.
  - `.claude/agents/planner.md`: documents the `depends_on: []` pitfall
    (`c3 po dry-run` rejects empty arrays — omit the field instead) and
    the `writes` collision detection. Adds a **"alternating
    parallel/serial pattern"** section that authorises ordering
    `depends_on` between stages when the user explicitly wants
    intermediate review/sync points, while preserving in-stage
    parallelism ≥ 2.
  - `.claude/docs/parallel-orchestra-manifest.md`: adds an "alternating
    parallel/serial pattern" section describing the structure with a
    pointer to the planner rule.
  - Memory: `feedback_claude_code_subagent_spec.md` gains section 6
    documenting that PO's auto-merge requires a clean main.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- `planner` agent now produces plan-reports designed for actual parallel
  execution. Previously the agent only knew "emit YAML frontmatter"; without
  rules for how to design the dependency graph it tended to write conservative
  serial chains where every task depended on the previous one, defeating the
  point of parallel-orchestra. Added a "並列実行のための設計指針" section
  with eight concrete rules:
  - depends_on only for true dependencies (not "just to be safe")
  - serialization self-check: chain length ≦ tasks/2
  - reviews go to the end via depends_on covering all dev tasks
  - decompose at file/module boundaries, not function-level or module-level
  - 1 TDD task = test + production + correction loop (do not split)
  - default granularity: file / feature
  - `writes` field is mandatory for collision detection
  - duplicate writes must be merged, sequenced via depends_on, or grouped
- `.claude/docs/parallel-orchestra-manifest.md`: example expanded to three
  dev tasks + a depends-on-all reviewer (showing real parallelism), plus
  inline comments and an "アンチパターン" section that calls out
  serialized chains, splitting TDD into separate tester/developer tasks,
  and empty/duplicate `writes` fields.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- `name` field on every agent definition under `.claude/agents/*.md`. The
  `description` field was already present on all agents, so this fills the
  remaining frontmatter gap. Values match the file stem (e.g. `architect`,
  `tdd-develop`).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- `c3 po run` no longer crashes on Windows when parallel-orchestra emits UTF-8
  characters on stderr. The `subprocess.Popen` call previously paired
  `text=True` with no explicit `encoding`, so Python decoded the pipe with the
  platform's locale (cp932 on JP Windows) and raised `UnicodeDecodeError` on
  the first non-ASCII byte. The Popen now passes `encoding="utf-8",
  errors="replace"` so PO's output decodes regardless of locale and a stray
  byte cannot tear down the stream mid-run.

### Added
- `tests/test_po_run.py::test_run_manifest_decodes_stderr_as_utf8` —
  regression test that asserts the Popen kwargs include `encoding="utf-8"`
  and `errors="replace"`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- `c3 init` no longer copies personal/working files when run against the live
  development tree. Two regressions in 0.2.0 caused this:
  1. `templates_dir()` walked up from `__file__` looking for any ancestor with
     `.claude/` + `pyproject.toml`. A wheel install in a venv that happened to
     live inside the C3 source tree (e.g. `claude-code-conductor/.venv/...`)
     therefore resolved to the dirty live `.claude/` instead of the bundled
     `_template/`. The dev fallback is now anchored to `<root>/src/c3/` ancestry
     so site-packages-loaded copies always use `importlib.resources`.
  2. `_copytree` did not apply the same exclusion rules as the build hook,
     so even legitimate editable installs (which intentionally serve the live
     `.claude/`) could leak personal files. `cli_init` and `cli_update` now
     share `c3._excludes` with `hatch_build.py`.

### Added
- `src/c3/_excludes.py` — single source of truth for excluded paths
  (reports/, memory/sessions/, memory/patterns.json, docs/decisions.md, etc.).
- Regression tests:
  - `tests/test_paths.py` — `_resolve_dev_template` rejects site-packages paths.
  - `tests/test_excludes.py` — KEEP_PATTERNS override EXCLUDE_PATTERNS.
  - `tests/test_cli_init.py::test_init_excludes_personal_files` — init does not
    leak personal files even when given a "dirty" template tree.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- PyPI distribution as `claude-code-conductor` (`pip install claude-code-conductor`)
- `c3` command-line interface with subcommands:
  - `c3 init` — scaffold `.claude/` into a project (refuses to overwrite without `--force`)
  - `c3 update` — refresh framework files; preserves user-managed files (reports/, memory/sessions/, founding docs)
  - `c3 list-agents` / `list-skills` / `list-commands` — inspect installed assets
  - `c3 doctor` — diagnose `.claude/`, `settings.json`, claude binary, parallel-orchestra availability
  - `c3 po dry-run <plan-report>` / `c3 po run <plan-report>` — invoke parallel-orchestra via subprocess
- Optional `parallel-orchestra` integration (loose coupling; PO is *not* in dependencies):
  - Runtime detection via `shutil.which` + `importlib.metadata`
  - `.claude/skills/parallel-execution.md` skill orchestrates D-0 → preflight → user approval → run → report
  - `planner` agent now emits required YAML frontmatter on plan-reports per `.claude/docs/parallel-orchestra-manifest.md`
  - `/develop` Phase D adds **D-0: 実行モード選択** (TDD 逐次 vs PO 並列)

### Changed
- Recommended install path is now `pip install claude-code-conductor` + `c3 init`. Manual `cp -r .claude/` still documented as an alternative.
- `worktree_guard.py` docstring: `C3_WORKTREE_GUARD` → `PO_WORKTREE_GUARD` (matches the implementation).

### Internal
- `src/c3/` package layout (hatchling build backend)
- Hatch custom build hook stages distributable subset of `.claude/` into `src/c3/_template/.claude/`
- Test suite under `tests/` (28 tests including loose-coupling guards and an opt-in `parallel-orchestra --dry-run` smoke)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- Initial Claude Code Conductor (C3) framework structure
- Multi-agent orchestration with parent-Claude-persona pattern
- Structured approval flow using `AskUserQuestion` tool
- `/init-session` — session initialization and state restoration
- `/start` — development workflow entry (interviewing → design → planning)
- `/develop` — implementation phase with TDD (tester → developer → tester)
- `/review` — review phase (code-reviewer + security-reviewer)
- `/promote-pattern` — promote candidate patterns to rules/skills
- `/doc` — architecture diagram and documentation generation
- `/mcp` — MCP server management (add / list / remove)
- `/extract-lib` — cross-project common code extraction and library design
- Code review checklist (`rules/code-review-checklist.md`)
- Security review checklist (`rules/security-review-checklist.md`)
- Hooks: `pre_tool.py`, `stop.py`, `log_agent.py`, `validate_skill_change.py`, `pre_compact.py`, `statusline.py`
- Session memory system with pattern trust scoring

### Fixed
- Force UTF-8 encoding on stdout/stderr for all hooks (Windows compatibility)
- Block `cd` commands in `pre_tool` hook to prevent CWD drift that breaks hook resolution
- Exclude all report/tmp file types from git tracking
